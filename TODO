Design:
    * Notebook = folder
    * Note = file. #conflicts?
    * Attachment(s) put in sub- folder with name of note
    * Download everything, dl listed notebooks, dl listed notes
    * Download only newer versions (based on mtime)

Cli
    * enote pull [notebook] [note]
    * enote init
    * enote list


Considerations:
    * How to backup tags (and other meta data)
    * Learn from geeknote, geeknote-improved
    * Installable? (Should be easy)
    * Strip special characters..
