TODO 0.1.0:
+ move all option handling to options.py (rename from config.py)
- argparse for parsing argumetnts - see CLI below
- option to only download from listed notebook(s)
- option to only download with specific tag
- option to enable/disable verbosity
- option to only pull notes newer than xxx
- option to select output format
- option to set basedir
- option to set max_notes
- option to set number of retries (download note content)
- "profiles" in enote.cfg ([enote] is general options, [profile:xxx] for specific sets of all/most data (at least sandbox, token, basedir))
- "list" command to list notes
- "list-notebooks" command to list notebooks
- "list-tags" command to list tags


Wish list:
- unbundle thrift library (or do something else)
- unbundle ENMLToHTML
- error handling
- error handling in executable
- download attachments (folder of same name than note)
- bundle enote.cft -> copy on firsts run and instruct user to create it (including instructions for how to get token)
- dependencies to setup.py
- move "mkdir" functionality to tools
- option to only pull differences (requires writing state to target dir)
