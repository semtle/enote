TODO 0.1.1:

Wish list:
- unbundle thrift library (or do something else)
- unbundle ENMLToHTML
- error handling
- error handling in executable
- download attachments (folder of same name than note)
- bundle enote.cft -> copy on firsts run and instruct user to create it (including instructions for how to get token)
- dependencies to setup.py
- option to only pull differences (requires writing state to target dir)
- cleanup TODOs
