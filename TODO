TODO 0.1.0:
+ "list" command to list notes
+ "list-notebooks" command to list notebooks
+ "list-tags" command to list tags
- option to only pull notes newer than xxx
- option to only download from listed notebook(s)
- option to only download with specific tag


Wish list:
- unbundle thrift library (or do something else)
- unbundle ENMLToHTML
- error handling
- error handling in executable
- download attachments (folder of same name than note)
- bundle enote.cft -> copy on firsts run and instruct user to create it (including instructions for how to get token)
- dependencies to setup.py
- move "mkdir" functionality to tools
- option to only pull differences (requires writing state to target dir)
